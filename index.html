Ruby/Mongo developer - Remote

Are you tired of a broken music industry where major labels play gatekeeper and cut artists out of the deal?  Sick of streaming services inundated with commercials?

Earbits is turning the model on its head.  On Earbits Radio, artists and labels bid for airtime on a per-stream basis and use the exposure to acquire fans and market products and live events.  
It is Google Adwords for music, where data, customer experience and economics surface the best material to each listener - all without commercials.

We’re looking for a back end engineer to help build the algorithm that will maximize artists’ results, listeners’ experience, and the company’s bottom line.  
Come help us do for music what Adwords did for every other small business industry.

Requirements (3 years commercial experience)
Ruby on Rails
Mongo DB
Heroku/Amazon EC2 experience

Niceties
Javascript / Backbone.js
Mobile dev
Facebook API
